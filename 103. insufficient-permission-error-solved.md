The error message says:

> **Failed to save ‘index.php’: Insufficient permissions. Select 'Retry as Admin' to retry as administrator.**

That means your PHP file is inside a **protected system folder** — in your case,
`C:\Program Files\first\index.php`,
and Windows doesn’t let normal users change files inside **Program Files** without admin rights.

---

### 💡 Why it happens:

Windows protects folders like `C:\Program Files` so no program accidentally modifies important files.
VS Code doesn’t have admin rights by default, so it can’t save files there.

---

### ✅ Solution Options

#### 🟢 Option 1: **Move your project folder**

Move your PHP project out of `C:\Program Files` to somewhere you own, such as:

```
C:\Users\<your-username>\Desktop\first
```

or

```
C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\first
```

Then open it in VS Code and you’ll be able to save normally.

---

#### 🟡 Option 2: **Run VS Code as Administrator**

If you *must* keep it in `C:\Program Files`, then:

1. Close VS Code.
2. Right-click the VS Code icon → **Run as administrator**.
3. Open your project again and save.

> ⚠️ This method works but is not recommended for development — it can cause security issues or accidental system changes.

---

#### 🟢 Recommended Setup for PHP (Best Practice)

Instead of working in `C:\Program Files`, create a folder like:

```
C:\php-projects\first
```

Then in terminal:

```bash
cd C:\php-projects\first
php -S localhost:8080
```

Now everything will run smoothly and save normally.
